    <p class="headingText">About Rock Interview</p>
    <p>Rock Interview aims to connect job applicants in need of mentoring with experienced professionals in the industry who are eager to 
        share their expertise and knowledge with new talent.</p>
    
    <p class="headingText">Rock Interview can Help You</p>
    <p class="headingText" style="margin-top: -3rem;">Interviewees with Relatively Low Experience</p>
    <p>Job applicants who have low levels of work-experience generally make easily avoidable errors in interviews such as not listening to 
        the questions asked properly in the hurry to show off their technical expertise. Rock Interview can help these interviewees perfect the art of answering to the point as well asaid in providing remedial measures for other common mistakes.</p>
    
    <p class="headingText">Applicants with Average to Considerable Experience</p>
    <p>The traditional style of job interviewing has steadily faded away in popularity and competency-based interviews are in vogue now. 
        This change in pattern necessitates an overhauling of established interview-preparedness processes. We can help mid-senior level 
        employees cope with the newer styles of interviewing adopted by companies globally today.</p>
    
    <p class="headingText">Candidates who are Specialists in Their Field</p>
    <p>For specialists who have more than 10 years of specific experience in a particular role or with a specific technology, 
        Rock Interview offers an opportunity to share your knowledge and improve the talent pool.</p>
